## Using the taco data we used in day 1, please identify 1-2 meaningful and relevant business questions that you believe are important to explore. 
This could relate to customer behavior, product performance, market trends, operational efficiency, or any other area of business interest.
Once you have chosen your question, use the data visualization techniques introduced in Lab 2 to analyze and answer it. 
In particular, apply your knowledge of how to create effective graphs using the ggplot2 package in R.

## Hint:
1. To help you get started, refer to the code and examples from the Lab 2 notebook, where we practiced building different types of visualizations with ggplot2. 
Think carefully about what type of chart (e.g., bar chart, line chart, scatter plot) best helps illustrate your findings and support your answer to the 
business question.

2. If you have difficulty loading the dataset, you can use the following R syntax: 

data <-read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/utjimmyx/workshop/master/taco.csv') 

## Your final output that is published at rpubs.com (your portfolio page) should include:

A clear statement of your business question

1-2 graphs created using ggplot2 that helps answer the questions

A short explanation (2â€“4 sentences) interpreting the graph and how it addresses your business questions
