## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. 

## Data

We will be using a dataset that is hosted on my Github website. 

You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(readr)
ad_sales <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/utjimmyx/regression/master/advertising.csv')
plot(sales ~ TV, data = ad_sales)
```

# Now let's fit a linear model with TV advertising as a predictor.

```{r}

fit <- lm(sales ~ TV, data = ad_sales)
summary(fit)

```

#### Question 2:Is there a relationship between TV advertising and Sales? If so, what does the relationship look like? Explain the coefficient and R square.
