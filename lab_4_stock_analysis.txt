## Introduction

This Quarto notebook explores stock market data using R packages like `quantmod`, `PerformanceAnalytics`, and `tidyverse`. We analyze and visualize data for multiple tickers including QQQ, TSLA, NVDA, and AMZN.

> **Context:** Tools like `quantmod` are widely used in algorithmic trading platforms and fintech firms. For example:
>
> - **Lemon Markets**, a European brokerage API platform, uses similar R-based or Python-based workflows to empower retail and institutional clients.
> - **QuantInsti**, a leading training provider in algorithmic trading, uses packages like `quantmod` and `PerformanceAnalytics` in strategy design, backtesting, and risk analysis.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(PerformanceAnalytics)
library(quantmod)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Load Stock Data
```{r}

QQQ <- getSymbols("QQQ", src = "yahoo", from = "2020-01-01", to = "2025-06-01", auto.assign = FALSE)
TSLA <- getSymbols("TSLA", src = "yahoo", from = "2015-01-01", to = "2025-06-01", auto.assign = FALSE)
NVDA <- getSymbols("NVDA", src = "yahoo", from = "2015-01-01", to = "2025-06-01", auto.assign = FALSE)
```

## Reflection Question:
What are some advantages of using programmatic data collection (via getSymbols) over manually downloading CSV files from Yahoo Finance?

## View Sample Data
```{r}
head(NVDA)
```

```{r}

barChart(NVDA, name = "NVDA Volume Bar Chart")

chartSeries(NVDA, type = "bar", theme = chartTheme("white"))
chartSeries(NVDA, type = "line", theme = chartTheme("white"))
chartSeries(NVDA, type = "candlesticks", theme = chartTheme("white"))
```

## Reflection Question:
Explore each chart type. How do line, bar, and candlestick charts differ in the kind of information they emphasize?

## Daily and Yearly Returns
```{r}
plot(dailyReturn(NVDA), main = "NVDA Daily Returns")
plot(yearlyReturn(NVDA), main = "NVDA Yearly Returns")
```

## Discussion Idea:
QuantInsti trains traders to analyze returns across multiple timeframes. Why might a yearly return plot give a different impression than a daily return plot?


```{r}

write.table(NVDA, file = "NVDA_stock.csv", row.names = FALSE, col.names = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

## Convert to Data Frame and Visualize
```{r}

NVDA_df <- data.frame(NVDA)
NVDA_df$time <- index(NVDA)

head(NVDA_df)

## Do you still remember the ggplot functions we used yesterday?
ggplot(NVDA_df, aes(x = time, y = NVDA.Adjusted)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "NVDA Adjusted Closing Price",
       x = "Date", y = "Adjusted Price")
```

## Critical Thinking:
Why might financial analysts prefer adjusted closing prices over raw closing prices when visualizing or modeling stock performance?

## Technical Indicators: Bollinger Bands

### What Are Bollinger Bands?
Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool used to measure a stockâ€™s price volatility and identify potential buying or selling opportunities.

They consist of three lines:

Middle Band: This is usually a simple moving average (SMA) â€” often a 20-day average.

Upper Band: This is the middle band plus 2 standard deviations.

Lower Band: This is the middle band minus 2 standard deviations.

These bands move with the stock price and expand or contract based on how volatile the stock is.

ðŸ§  Why Use Bollinger Bands?
They help answer questions like:

Is the stock price relatively high or low compared to recent history?

Is the stock entering a period of increased volatility?

ðŸ“Œ How to Read Bollinger Bands
When the price touches or moves above the upper band:
â†’ The stock might be overbought (price could be too high).
â†’ Some traders see this as a sell signal.

When the price touches or falls below the lower band:
â†’ The stock might be oversold (price could be too low).
â†’ This could be a buy signal.

```{r}
AMZN <- getSymbols("AMZN", src = "yahoo", auto.assign = FALSE)

chartSeries(AMZN, subset = 'last 3 months', theme = chartTheme("white"))
addBBands(n = 20, sd = 2, maType = "SMA", draw = "bands", on = -1)
```

## Reflection:
Bollinger Bands are popular in technical analysis. What kind of market behavior do the upper and lower bands signal? How might a quant fund use this indicator?

## What is one key insight or skill you learned today? Briefly explain it in your own words.

## What is one concept or tool from todayâ€™s session that you would like to apply in the future? Describe how you might use it.
